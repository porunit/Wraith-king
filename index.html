        <article class="description"><h5><span class="icon"></span>Ostarion, the Wraith King</h5>
            For untold years, King Ostarion built a kingdom from
            the remains of his enemies. It was an obsessive's errand,
            done to pass the long eternities of a monarchy that seemed
            fated never to end. He believed that as long as he built up
            the towers of his palace, he could not die. But eventually
            he learned that he had been deluded... that bone itself could
            perish. Deeply mistrustful of flesh, he sought a more permanent
            way of extending his reign, and at last settled on pursuit of
            wraith energy, a form of pure spirit given off by certain dark
            souls at death. Should he infuse himself with Wraith Essence,
            he thought he might create a body as luminous and eternal as
            his ego. On the millennial solstice known as Wraith-Night, he
            submitted to a rite of transformation, compelling his subjects
            to harvest enough souls to fuel his ambition for immortality. No
            one knows how many of his champions died, for the only survivor who
            mattered was the Wraith King who rose with the sun on the following morn.
            Now he rarely spends a moment on his glowing throne--but strides out with
            sword drawn, demanding a fealty that extends far beyond death.
